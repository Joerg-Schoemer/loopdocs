## What is *Loop*?

_<span translate="no">Loop</span>_&nbsp;is an app you build and load on an iPhone.

After building the&nbsp;_<span translate="no">Loop</span>_&nbsp;app:

* You enter your personal therapy settings (e.g., carbohydrate ratio, basal rates, insulin sensitivity)
* You enter the carbs you eat
*&nbsp;_<span translate="no">Loop</span>_&nbsp;uses this information, your insulin on board (IOB) and glucose data, to determine how much insulin you need to bring your blood glucose within the target range you set
* You can choose to have&nbsp;_<span translate="no">Loop</span>_&nbsp;automatically control insulin dosing (closed-loop mode) or have&nbsp;_<span translate="no">Loop</span>_&nbsp;recommend insulin that you manually accept or modify (open-loop mode)
