# Welcome to Loop

Welcome to the "LoopDocs" website.  This is a great place to start to learn all things Loop.

This site takes you step-by-step through the process to build, set up and operate the Loop app.  You do not need a technical or computer background to do this.

Loop requires a substantial time commitment.  You need to learn the information on this site and follow the steps carefully. Consider doing this over a period of time and reviewing the materials more than once.

You will need to test and perhaps adjust your settings to be successful with Loop, or any hybrid closed-loop system. In addition to the documentation found on this site, you can find assistance in a support forum: [Finding Help](#finding-help).

Once you are enjoying all the benefits of Loop, you should regularly follow one or more support forums for important updates on Loop. Spending this time is important for success in building and operating Loop safely.

This website is updated regularly to keep pace with Loop developments and Apple releases.

## What is Loop

Loop is an app you build and load on an iPhone (or iPod).

After building the Loop app:

* You enter your personal therapy settings (e.g., carbohydrate ratio, basal rates, insulin sensitivity)
* You enter the carbs you eat
* Loop uses this information, your insulin on board (IOB) and glucose data, to determine how much insulin you need to bring your blood glucose within the target range you set
* You can choose to have Loop automatically control insulin dosing (closed-loop mode) or have Loop recommend insulin that you can accept or modify (open-loop mode)
    * Loop requires a [compatible continuous glucose monitor (CGM)](build/step4.md) and a [compatible pump](build/step3.md) for closed-loop operation
    * If you use a compatible Medtronic pump or Eros pods, you will also need a [small device](build/step5.md) for the iPhone and pump to communicate.

## Important Disclaimer

Please consult with your health care professional regarding your diabetes management.

* The Loop app is an open source project used by many, but it is not approved for therapy by any government organization.
* **You take full responsibility for building and running this system and do so at your own risk.**


## Volunteer Community

Loop has been, and continues to be, developed and supported by volunteers. From the code to this website, you are able to loop because many volunteers have given their personal and family time.  So please add your time by reading this website thoroughly before embarking on your Loop journey.

### Finding Help

Volunteers generously provide support for Loop via online platforms. You have a [number of options](build/step12.md) for joining conversations on loop and asking for help.  Links to the main platforms are listed below.  Non-US Loop users in Italy, Australia, and several other countries have also formed Facebook (FB) groups.

  * The [Looped Group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/TheLoopedGroup) on Facebook. Looped Group is the original FB group for DIY looping systems. There are lot of active members there with an excellent history of helping people.
  * Loop and Learn is a community that provides Loop-centric information, a T1D Speaker Series covering many topics of general diabetes interest as well as Loop-specific chats, alerts whenever there is an update to iOS and Xcode, Quick Tips and articles written by mentors providing their Loop experience.
      * [LoopandLearn Facebook Group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/LOOPandLEARN)
      * [LoopandLearn Website](https://www.loopandlearn.org)
      * [LoopandLearn YouTube Channel](https://youtube.com/loopandlearn)
* The [LoopTips](https://loopkit.github.io/looptips/) website provides non-build information that is helpful once you are looping, e.g., how to print endo reports, find Loop data, deal with therapy settings changes, etc.
* Many Loopers use [Nightscout](nightscout/overview.md). Nightscout help can be found in the [CGM in the Cloud](https://www.facebook.com/groups/CGMinthecloud) Facebook group.
* For those interested in what is coming next for Loop and those who prefer not to use Facebook, join [Loop Zulipchat](https://loop.zulipchat.com) and be sure to subscribe to all the streams or you'll miss some interesting conversations.
* Loop has an instagram account @diy.loop where some updates are shared.
