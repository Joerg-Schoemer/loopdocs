Welcome to the *LoopDocs* website where you can learn about the *Loop* app.

## What is the *Loop* App?

The *Loop* app is an automated insulin delivery application that you build and load on an iPhone.

* You enter your personal therapy settings (e.g., carbohydrate ratio, basal rates, insulin sensitivity)
* You enter the carbs you eat
* &nbsp;_<span translate="no">Loop</span>_&nbsp;uses this information, your insulin on board (IOB) and glucose data, to determine how much insulin you need to bring your blood glucose within the target range you set
* You can choose to have&nbsp;_<span translate="no">Loop</span>_&nbsp;automatically control insulin dosing (closed-loop mode) or have&nbsp;_<span translate="no">Loop</span>_&nbsp;recommend insulin that you manually accept or modify (open-loop mode)

    * It was created while Reese was using an earlier version of Loop, but it still a great introduction
    * Special thanks to Tina and Reese Hammer for the terrific video
    * Special thanks to Matthew Fouse for the generous use of his beautiful graphics

## What are my next steps?

This site shows you step-by-step how to [**build**](intro/requirements.md), [**set up**](loop-3/loop-3-overview.md) and [**operate**](operation/loop/open-loop.md) the *Loop* app.

* **You do not need a technical or computer background to do this**
* **You can choose to build the *Loop* app several ways:**
    * Use a [browser](gh-actions/gh-overview.md) on any computer or tablet and install it on your *iPhone* via *TestFlight*
    * Use an up-to-date [*Mac* Computer](build/overview.md) and install it directly on your *iPhone*

In order to become proficient with the app, you should learn the information on this site. Consider doing this over a period of time and reviewing the materials more than once.

* You should test and perhaps adjust your settings to be successful with the *Loop* app (or any hybrid closed-loop system)
* You will find links as you read to a robust volunteer support community

There is a common saying in our community:

> Do It Yourself (DIY) does not mean Do It Alone!

Once you are using the app, you should regularly follow one or more support forums for important updates on the *Loop* app. Spending this time is important for success in building and operating the *Loop* app safely.

This website is updated regularly to keep pace with development of the *Loop* app and *Apple* releases.

## Important Disclaimer

Please consult with your health care professional regarding your diabetes management.

* The *Loop* app is an open source project used by many, but it is not approved for therapy by any government organization.
* **You take full responsibility for building and running this system and do so at your own risk.**

## Volunteer Community

The *Loop* app has been, and continues to be, developed and supported by volunteers. From the code to this website, you are able to use this app because many volunteers have given their personal and family time.

Please add your time by reading this website before embarking on your&nbsp;_<span translate="no">Loop</span>_&nbsp;journey.
