## GitHub Build Loop Errors

This method is fairly new so there are not many error screens captured.

There is a separate section for each step in the process.

1. [GitHub Add Identifiers Error Messages](#github-add-identifiers-error-messages)
1. [GitHub Create Certificates Error Messages](#github-create-certificates-error-messages)
1. [GitHub Build Loop Error Messages](#github-build-loop-error-messages)

If you discover a new error, please reach out to help us update the documentation.

### GitHub Build Loop Error Messages

These error messages are only for people who have successfully built using github Build Actions. There are many other errors that might pertain to people who have not completed all the build steps in [GitHub First Time](gh-first-time.md).

#### Could not install WWDR certificate

Assuming you have successfully built before:

* If the details show this message, "Could not install WWDR certificate", make sure your developer account is in good standing and that there are no agreements that need to be accepted
* Repeat the build and it should be fine the next time
