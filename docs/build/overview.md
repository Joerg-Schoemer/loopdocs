# Overview of Build Process

The build process is straightforward if you follow the step-by-step instructions.

!!! info "The Build Steps show how to:"

    * Check that you have a phone, pump and CGM that works with Loop
    * Tell you about the RileyLink compatible device and how to get one
    * Prepare your computer
    * Download the Loop code to your computer
    * Build the Loop app on your phone

After the build, follow steps to [Set up](../operation/overview.md) and [Operate](../operation/features/carbs.md) the Loop app

We recommend you start by clicking through the Build Steps from 1 through 14 and read the top three boxes on each page. On a desktop, you can use `n` for next and `p` for previous.

!!! abstract "Summary"
!!! question "FAQs"

And yes - we do know how to count, but step 7 is no longer required and we didn't want to rename the pages.

Next, read the pages completely for Steps 1 through 14 and skim [Oh dear! Build errors?](build_errors.md). Most of the mistakes you can make when building have already been made. The Build Errors page shows how to fix them. If those steps do not help, there are [mentors](../index.md#finding-help) ready and willing to assist.

When you are ready to proceed, complete the tasks on each page.  You can do one a day, take a week per step or blaze through them quickly.  Just be sure to read carefully and if you are confused - reach out for help.

!!! example "Take it one step at a time..."

    If you have limited time, you can stop at one of the steps and come back later. The end of each step is a nice stopping point but you can stop at any time and return later.

To summarize:

1. Read just the highlights (top three boxes) for Steps 1 - 14
1. Read each page for Steps 1 - 14 and skim Build Errors
1. Complete the tasks on each page
