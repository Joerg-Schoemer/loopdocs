# Overview of Build Process

The build process is straightforward if you follow the step-by-step instructions.

!!! info "The Build Steps will help you:"

    * Check that you have a phone, pump and CGM that works with Loop
    * Learn about the RileyLink compatible device and how to get one
    * Prepare your computer
    * Download the Loop code to your computer
    * Build the Loop app on your phone

After the build, keep following along in the docs as you [Set up](../operation/overview.md) and [Operate](../operation/loop/open-loop.md) the Loop app.

## What do I need to Loop?

Loop has both hardware and software requirements. In general, to use Loop you need to have seven components.

1. [Computer](../build/step1.md#macos) (Mac preferred)
1. [Compatible iPhone/iPod Touch](../build/step2.md)
1. Compatible insulin pump: [Medtronic or Omnipod](../build/step3.md)
1. [Compatible CGM](../build/step4.md)
1. [RileyLink Compatible Device](../build/step5.md) (not needed for Omnipod DASH)
1. [Apple Developer Membership](../build/step6.md) (not needed if you rebuild weekly)
1. [Xcode (a free Apple application)](../build/step8.md)

If building to a [Simulator](../version/simulator.md) first to try things out, the only requirements are a computer and Xcode.

## Getting Ready to Build

We recommend you start by clicking through the Build Steps from 1 through 14 and read the top three boxes on each page. On a desktop, you can use `n` for next and `p` for previous.

!!! abstract "Summary"
!!! question "FAQs"

And yes - we do know how to count, but step 7 is no longer required and we didn't want to rename the pages.

Next, read the pages completely for Steps 1 through 14 and skim [Oh dear! Build errors?](build_errors.md). Most of the mistakes you can make when building have already been made. The Build Errors page shows how to fix them. You don't need to understand this page - just know that it exists.

When you are ready to proceed, complete the tasks on each page.  You can do one a day, take a week per step or blaze through them quickly.  Just be sure to read carefully and if you are confused - reach out for help: [Finding Help](../intro/loopdocs-how-to.md#how-to-find-help).

!!! example "Take it one step at a time..."

    The end of each step is a nice stopping point but you can stop at any time and return later.

To summarize our recommendation:

1. Read just the highlights (top three boxes) for Steps 1 - 14
1. Read each page for Steps 1 - 14 and skim Build Errors
1. Complete the tasks on each page

## What if I get stuck?

Try to:

* Scroll back in the directions and see if you missed a paragraph or step.
* Compare your screen's display with the graphics in the step. Is something different or does yours have an error message? If you have an error message, does it guide you to the problem and solution?
* If you are still stumped - reach out for help: [Finding Help](../intro/loopdocs-how-to.md#how-to-find-help).
