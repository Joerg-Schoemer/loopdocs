## Make Plans for your `Loop Data`

!!! info "Time Estimate"
    - Apple Health: 0 minutes, already a part of your system
    - *Tidepool*: 30 minutes to set up an account
        * option: add *Tidepool* Mobile to your phone
        * option: add upload to *Tidepool* as a Service in the *Loop* app
    - *Nightscout*:
        * 1-2 hours to build it yourself if you've never done it before
        * 1 hour to choose and sign up for a service if you want to pay someone

!!! abstract "Summary"
    - Review the three major systems that can store and show your Loop data.
    - Set up either *Tidepool* or *Nightscout* prior to your next endo appointment to provide Looping data to review.

!!! question "FAQs"
    - **Do I have to set one of these up?** Apple Health is already built into your iPhone and used by Loop, so there's no setup involved.
    - **Do I need all three?** No, you can choose what suits you best. You can add a data system later.
    - **Why do I need any of these?** With the *Loop* app, your PDM (Omnipod) is not used or your pump (Medtronic) does not have sufficient memory for all the commands. Your endo will have nothing to download at your next visit. You need to provide them with the information.
    - **Is it worth the time to setup *Nightscout*? I feel like I'm already doing so much outside my comfort zone.** Yes. Loopers find it is definitely worth the time investment.  *Nightscout* provides essential data for evaluating settings and useful alarms and alerts.  Some Facebook help sites require *Nightscout* data to diagnose and suggest steps to address problems. There are fee-based services that will set up *Nightscout* for you, if you don't want to build it yourself.

## Data Options

Take some time to familiarize yourself with these data options and choose your preferred system(s). Many Loopers use all three for various aspects.

* [*Apple Health* app](../faqs/apple-health-faqs.md#healthkit-plots)
    * Great resource to view on the Loop phone
    * Not so great for showing your endo
* [*Tidepool*](https://loopkit.github.io/looptips/data/tidepool/)
    * Some endo offices will use your *Tidepool* website when you provide them with an invitation
    * Many users of the mobile app like the note taking ability
        * The mobile app also uploads *Apple HealthKit* data to *Tidepool* when the "Read from *Apple Health*" option is selected
    * With Version 3.2 of the *Loop* app, you can upload directly as a Service within the *Loop* app
        * If you use the mobile *Tidepool* app on your phone for notetaking, be sure to disable the read from Apple Health option in the the mobile *Tidepool* app settings to avoid duplicate uploads
        * If you use the mobile *Tidepool* app on your phone for uploading only, then it is no longer needed when you upload directly to *Tidepool* as a Service within the *Loop* app
* *Nightscout*:
    * [LoopDocs: *Nightscout*](../nightscout/overview.md) section of LoopDocs, has Loop-centric information about *Nightscout*
    * [LoopTips: *Nightscout*](https://loopkit.github.io/looptips/data/nightscout/) link to LoopTips page on *Nightscout*
    * [*Nightscout*: Documentation](https://nightscout.github.io/) official *Nightscout* site with lots of information about building and using *Nightscout*
    * *Nightscout* has a lot of useful alarms and alerts, provides a care portal and detailed reports
    * For those who assist someone who is Looping, *Nightscout* enables the caregiver to provide remote commands to the Looper's phone
        * `Loop 2` allows overrides to be enabled or disabled remotely
        * `Loop 3` allows remote commands for carbs, bolus or overrides
        * The [*Loop Caregiver*](../nightscout/loop-caregiver.md) app is under development, but already has sufficient capabilities to be useful for caregivers to monitor and provide remote commands to their Looper's phone

*Nightscout* options include free or nominal cost sites you build yourself or there are several *Nightscout* as a Service vendors who provide turn-key sites for a monthly fee. Links to the options are found in the [*Nightscout*: Documentation](https://nightscout.github.io/) - note that link takes you to a different site.

*Nightscout* provides a secure, real-time Dashboard with status of the *Loop* app visible to anyone with access codes and the internet. It is required for remote commanding.
