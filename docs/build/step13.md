# Step 13: Download Loop Code

!!! info "Time Estimate"
    - 10 minutes to read this page
    - Wait until Step 14 to download Released Loop code (New Workspace Method)

!!! abstract "Summary"
    - **All Loopers:** Loop can only be built with the Workspace Build method
        - To make it easy, there's a script for you to use
    - **New Loopers:** Review this page until told to go to Step 14
    - **Repeat Builders:** Optional information for the curious
    - **Advanced Users:** Read all of Step 13

!!! question "FAQs"
    - **When do I need to download new Loop code?** You need new code before you build
    - **What if I want to get a new feature in my copy of Loop?** Start at [Updating](updating.md)
    - **How do I find out about new features?** Please see [Loop Release FAQs](../faqs/release-faqs.md)
    - **What do I do if there is a major release (by Apple) of new iOS?** The short answer is wait a bit:
        * It's a good idea to be prepared to rebuild before updating your phone to the new iOS
        * This is even more important when there has been a major change to iOS or Xcode
        * Check with the experts - there will be announcements in all the [Loop Social Media](../intro/loopdocs-how-to.md#how-to-find-help) sites
    - **How often to I have to rebuild?**
        1. You must build when your app expires (one year paid, one week free)
        1. It is recommended you rebuild more frequently to avoid panic when your app is about to expire as explained in [Updating FAQs](../faqs/update-faqs.md)

## New Loopers

You will do the download in the next step.

For those who are new to Loop, never built Loop or can't remember anything about the last time you built Loop:

Head to Step 14 to [Build the Loop App](step14.md).

## Repeat Builders

In you haven't built in a while, but have been using Loop for a long time:

* The method to build Loop changed with the advent of Xcode 13 (Sept 2021).
* Loop must be built with a workspace build as explained in Step 14 [Build the Loop App](step14.md).
* The Dosing Strategy of Automatic Bolus or Temp Basal Only is in the released version of Loop (Aug 2021)
    * You do not need a special branch to get this feature


## Advanced Users Only

!!! abstract "About this Section"

    If you are an advanced user who wants to build the development branch - this section is for you.

    Everyone else - head to Step 14 to [Build](step14.md) the released version of the Loop App.

!!! warning "Important"

    * When you clone a fresh copy, you must use a directory that does not already have a folder called LoopWorkspace in it.
    * As of June 24, 2022, a fresh download (or pull) of Loop-dev no longer requires carthage

Yes - this section is "out-of-place", but the Step 14 Build Loop App page is already very long and complicated. If you can build Loop-dev, you can find this section.

**Only build the dev branch if you're a developer/experienced user**

### About Loop-dev

Please read [What's going on in the dev branch?](../faqs/branch-faqs.md#whats-going-on-in-the-dev-branch) before deciding to test the dev branch.

- Note, the dev branch requires a minimum of iOS 14 on your device
- Once you install the dev branch on a device, you must delete the app to return to master (the released version), which means all settings will need to be entered in master and a new pod started
- The dev branch Loop user interface is updated - as an experienced Looper, you will notice the difference
- Updated documentation is a work-in-progress located under the [Loop 3](../loop-3/loop-3-overview.md) tab of LoopDocs

### Downloading Loop-dev

* Review the instructions here: [LoopWorkspace README](https://github.com/LoopKit/LoopWorkspace#readme) 

* Use finder to create a new folder, typically in Downloads
    - Navigate to Downloads
    - Best practice - create a new folder called Loop-dev_YYMMDD where you replace YYMMDD with today's date.
    - Hold down the control key and click on that folder to open a menu
    - Select (near the bottom) New Terminal at Folder

* Copy and paste the lines below into that terminal window
* There cannot already be a folder called LoopWorkspace at this location - see best practice in list above

```
git clone --branch=dev --recurse-submodules https://github.com/LoopKit/LoopWorkspace
cd LoopWorkspace
xed .
```

These three lines will download the code and open Xcode. Be sure to select LoopWorkspace and your phone.

### Signing Loop-dev

If you choose to sign manually instead of using the new capability (next paragraph), you must sign 6 targets (add these 2 to the usual 4)

* Loop Intent Extension
* Learn

With Loop-dev, the signing of targets can be done by editing a single file:

* Edit the LoopConfigOverride.xcconfig file (you can do this in Xcode)
* The next to last line says `// Put your team id here for signing`
* The last line starts with two slashes `//` â€“ remove those
* Replace the ID to the right of the equal sign with your Apple Developer ID
* Apple Developer Team ID can be found for your account (after you sign in) at:
    * [https://developer.apple.com/account/#!/membership](https://developer.apple.com/account/#!/membership)

!!! warning "Loop.xcodeproj/project.pbxproj"

    If you manually sign any of the targets, for example as an alternative way to get your Developer ID, the file in the Loop folder called `Loop.xcodeproj/project.pbxproj` is automatically modified to use that target name.

    Once that happens, the feature that enables Xcode to use the `LOOP_DEVELOPMENT_TEAM` keyword in the LoopConfigOverride.xcconfig is no longer available.

    To restore that capability, navigate in the terminal to the LoopWorkspace/Loop folder and issue this command:

    ```
    git restore Loop.xcodeproj/project.pbxproj
    ```


#### Loop-dev with Free Account

Yes you can build Loop-dev with the free account (Personal Team). There are some extra steps needed compared to the steps given for Loop 2.2.x on the [Build Step 14: Free Account](step14.md#free-account) section.

Note - if you know your Personal Team ID, you can enter it as directed in [Signing Targets](#signing-targets) above.

1. You must remove additional capabilities, the complete list is:
    * **Loop Target:** Push Notifications; Siri and **Time Sensitive Notifications**
    * **Watch App Extension Target:** Siri
1. Add the keyword `SIRI_DISABLED` to the LoopConfigOverride.xcconfig file
    * Examine the file and find the line that starts with `SWIFT_ACTIVE_COMPILATION_CONDITIONS = $(inherited)`
    * Insert the new keyword (separated by a space) anywhere after `$(inherited)` and before the slashes near the end of the line


### Build Loop-dev

* There are some package dependencies (new for Loop-dev) that are resolved first and then the indexing takes place
* If you notice a red x in Xcode (indicating an error) while it is resolving packages and indexing - please follow the steps for [Couldn't Get Revision for Package Dependency](build_errors.md#couldnt-get-revision-for-package-dependency)
* Once the packages are resolved and the indexing has started, you can build the app following the directions in the "Build Loop" section on the next page: [Step 14: Build Loop App: Build Loop](step14.md#build-loop).

We suggest reading the tips below on keeping Loop-dev updated. Checking for updates every week is a good idea.  Also - subscribe to all the streams on [Loop Zulipchat](https://loop.zulipchat.com) to make sure you don't miss critical information.

### Update Loop-dev

While Loop-dev is under active test, you will want to update frequently.

* Some users like to use [GitKraken](https://support.gitkraken.com/) to assist them (link takes you to a tutorial video).
* Some just repeat the cloning.
* Some are comfortable with the command line git commands described on [here](loopworkspace.md#updating-loop-using-loopworkspace).


### Remove carthage

!!! abstract "Completely Optional"
    This section is completely optional.

    It is only provided to assist those who installed carthage for Loop and want to remove it.

* You no longer need carthage, and can uninstall it from your system.

* You do NOT need to uninstall carthage - your choice. If you share the computer with someone else, make sure they don't need carthage.

First copy and paste this phrase into the terminal and hit return:

```
carthage version
```

* If the response gives you a version number, then carthage is installed - you can uninstall it if you choose

* If the response indicates, "carthage: command not found", you are done - it is no longer needed to build Loop-dev

If carthage is on your system, you can choose to remove it (completely optional with respect to building Loop with updated code).

Copy and paste the following line into the terminal window and hit return.  

```
rm -rf /usr/local/bin/carthage
```

!!! danger ""
    If the response says you don't have the privilege to do this - it is best to stop.

    * That means carthage was installed by another user - not you.
    * Check with them to make sure they don't require carthage on the computer.
    * The presence or absence of carthage no longer affects the build process for Loop - so it is fine to leave it on your computer.

Assuming the previous line did not give an error, then copy and paste this line into the terminal window and hit return to complete carthage removal:

```
sudo rm -rf /Library/Frameworks/CarthageKit.framework
```

You will be prompted for a password when you hit enter on the second line.   It is the same password you use in order to log into the computer.   It will not echo to the screen.
