# LoopDocs How-to

## How to Ask for Help

If you are having trouble building or using your Loop app, there are some important steps to get responses to your question, while also being considerate of our volunteers' time.

1. Always search in **both** [LoopDocs](overview-intro.md#website-search) and your favorite [support group](../index.md#finding-help). 
    * Confused on how to search in a Facebook group? [Here is a video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vSN6C-Uo04) to help.
2.  If you use Facebook, click on the Announcements section; many posts asking for help are already answered in the pinned announcements.
3.  Don't post a duplicate question in multiple groups (mentors monitor many groups). Only post to a different group if you have had no responses for several hours.
4.  If a LoopDocs search, FB or zulipchat search, and a check of Looped Group announcements haven't answered your question, then post for help. Review the [tips for how to post for help](../build/step12.md) so that our volunteers get all the information they'll need to help you, without needing to ask 40 questions first.    
5.  Leave your question posted even after you've gotten an answer, but edit the original post to add the word **RESOLVED** at the beginning of the original post. 
    * This helps other Loopers who have the same question
    * This helps mentors know they don't need to respond to help you


## How to Improve LoopDocs

Please submit suggestions for updates and improvements to this documentation. There are many pages of content and we welcome reviewers to help find typos and outdated info/links. If you notice a typo, poor word choice or some explanation that could be improved or clarified, there are a few options. The first two options use github, a website where open-source code and documentation is often shared. You can only use github if you have an account (it's free).

1. You can issue a Pull Request (best option if it is a simple typo or wording update)
2. You can open an Issue (best option if a major rewrite is needed or you think a conversation would help), or 
3. You can post on Facebook or Zulipchat 

### Pull Requests and Issues

If you decide to do a Github Pull Request (PR) or create an Issue, first look to see if someone has already opened a [PR](https://github.com/LoopKit/loopdocs/pulls) or [Issue](https://github.com/LoopKit/loopdocs/issues) on the topic so you don't create a duplicate.

* If a PR or Issue on the topic is open, feel free to add your comments (don't be shy), but please don't create a duplicate
* If a PR doesn't exist, watch this [LoopDocs Pull Request video](https://youtu.be/6qSppvgGxpg) on how to create one (it's easy, video is less than 5 minutes)
* If your Issue is new, please add it by clicking on the `New Issue` button
    * Give the Issue a descriptive title
    * Indicate which page or pages need updating , along with a brief description of the problem(s)

### Facebook or Zulipchat
Helpful tips for providing LoopDocs feedback through Facebook and/or Zulipchat:

* In [Looped Group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/TheLoopedGroup) - make sure your post is clear that you have a comment about LoopDocs in particular.
* In Loop Zulipchat, please use the [documentation stream, Loopdocs Issue](https://loop.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/270362-documentation/topic/Loopdocs.20Issue) channel.
