# Introduction to LoopDocs

It is totally understandable if the thought of building and operating your own Loop app feels intimidating. As you learn the steps explained in LoopDocs, this will start feeling more comfortable.

## What if I'm not sure I want to commit?

You can build Loop and practice with a simulated phone, CGM and  pump. You can "dose" the simulated pump and your real pump at the same time and watch the glucose predictions.

Trying it with a simulator can help you decide if you want to move forward with purchasing the hardware and Apple Developers license each year for Loop.

Note - you will need to have access to a computer as an absolute minimum. Please review [SImulator Build](../version/simulator.md) for more information.


## Building Loop

Building the Loop app is straightforward. There are a lot of steps because they are divided into short segments.

!!! warning "Best Practice: Learn to Build"
    Users are strongly encouraged to build Loop for themselves. 
    
    * It is not recommended and no links to  providers who build Loop as a service will be found in LoopDocs, but there are such services
    * If you choose to take advantage of such a service, you still should read all the sections of LoopDocs
    * You will still need to procure compatible CGM, pump, phone and RileyLink
        * DASH pods do not require the RileyLink, but that version is not yet released

## Using Loop

A significant amount of content is provided on this website and via link to other sources. Please review these pages when initially setting up and learning to use Loop.

Some techniques are specific to Loop, but the general concepts of how man-made insulin works and stategies to test basal, carb ratios and insulin sensitivity apply to all the hybrid closed-loop systems, commercial and open source.
