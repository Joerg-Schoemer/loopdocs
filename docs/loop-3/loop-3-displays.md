# Displays

## Main Loop Screen

The main Loop screen contains a Heads-Up Display at the top (when in portrait mode) with various graphs in the middle and a toolbar at the bottom of the screen.

!!! info "New Look for Home Screen"
    The Loop-dev Home screen was redesigned to reduce the cognitive load for users. To do that, only the information needed to see status at a "glance" is provided.
    
    Please give the difference a chance before you ask what happened to something you were used to seeing on the home screen.   The more detailed information that some long-term loopers may want is still provided in lower level screens.

## Heads-Up Display

The Heads-Up Display (HUD) for Loop-dev has been simplified.  This display has 3 icons. The left icon shows the CGM value, the middle icon indicates Loop status and the right icon show pump status. More details are found under [HUD Details](#hud-details).

!!! info "For Pod Users"
    Yes the circular life-cycle icon is gone. When the pod is close to expiration, a warning indicator shows up under the pump icon.

## Charts

The Loop charts are similar to Loop 2.2.x, refer to [Loop Charts](../operation/loop-settings/displays.md#charts)

## Toolbar

The Loop toolbar is similar to Loop 2.2.x although there are some details that differ as discussed in [Loop-dev Features](loop-3-features.md).

Loop Settings are shown when tapping on the gear icon. The Loop-dev Settings display is substantially different than for Loop 2.2.x.  Refer to the [Loop-dev Settings](loop-3-settings.md) page.

## Loop Widget on Lock Screen

Loop has a widget which can be added to the lock screen. The example graphic below shows the Dexcom G6 widget above the Loop-dev widget.
