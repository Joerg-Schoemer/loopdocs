## Omnipod Common Pairing

A [video is found here for pairing a DASH pod](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1mN5s8-oorvoa-gbjAaYbnUnl_-vvuhNC/view?usp=sharing). Once the pod starts priming, you may want to skip ahead in the video (it takes about a minute to prime).

### Pod Pairing

A [video is found here for pairing an Omnipod DASH pod](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1mN5s8-oorvoa-gbjAaYbnUnl_-vvuhNC/view?usp=sharing). Once the pod starts priming, you may want to skip ahead in the video (priming takes a minute to complete). The Omnipod Common pairing protocol is the same. The difference is that Omnipod requires a RileyLink compatible device and Omnipod DASH does not. There are also slight differences in some of the text, e.g., Omnipod DASH uses a blue needle cap and Omnipod has a clear needle cap.
