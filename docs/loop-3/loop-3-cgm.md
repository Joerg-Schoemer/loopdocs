# CGM Configuration

The CGM configuration can be selected from the [HUD](loop-3-displays.md#heads-up-display) or from the [Loop Settings](loop-3-settings.md) screen.

## Add CGM

If no CGM has been configured, the user has an expanded choice of CGM as well as a simulator:

* CGM that reside on the same phone (internet not required)
    * Dexcom G5
    * Dexcom G6
    * (Medtronic Pump only) Guardian - added through Pump
* CGM that require active internet
    * Nightscout Remote CGM
    * Dexcom Share

The addition of the Nightscout Remote CGM enables the use of Loop 3 with any sensor that can be uploaded to your Nightscout URL.

## CGM Icon

Tapping on the CGM icon shows more information about the last CGM reading. The same screen is obtained by tapping on Loop Settings->CGM.  

The graphic below shows result of tapping on the CGM icon when using a Dexcom G6.  It includes the time of the last reading to the nearest second, along with other information about that sensor and transmitter. It also has an option to go to the Dexcom app on the same device.

## Modify CGM

To modify the selected CGM, it must first be deleted. Then a new CGM can be added.  Scroll to the bottom of the current CGM screen and tap `Delete CGM`.

When changing Dexcom Transmitters, you must first `Delete CGM` and then add the CGM back with the new Transmitter serial number.
