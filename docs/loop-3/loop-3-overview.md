# Loop 3 Overview


Loop 3.0 is the next big release. It is being developed and tested under the dev branch (Loop-dev). Loop-dev has significant improvements and looks different (in some ways) from the Loop 2.2.x versions.

!!! info "Loop-dev"
    The dev branch of Loop is currently under test by experienced loopers. If you are testing Loop-dev, the version number reported on your settings screen is Loop v2.3.0 (57).

    To report to developers about which particular version of Loop-dev you are running, look at the top of the [Loop Report](settings.md#issue-a-loop-report) under `Build Details`. The 7-digit alphanumeric indication to the right of workspaceGitRevision is sufficient.

    When this version is released, it will be Loop 3.0 and the interface for Loop 3.x versions will use this updated documentation.

    To make life easier for those of us preparing the new documentation, the wording on many pages in the Loop 3 section is set in the future - after the release

    This page will be updated and it and the rest of the Loop 3 section will be moved to Set Up App with the Loop 2.2.x version maintained under a sub-menu


## New with Loop 3

!!! info ""
    Information from this section will be moved to the Version / Releases page after release.

Loop 3 redesigns the app, building off work by Tidepool and DIY contributors. Some changes may not be obvious to the user, but make the app more robust.

Here are some highlights:

* Onboarding protocol with guardrails to help configure settings
* Streamlined main screen display and user experience
* Better alerts and notifications
* Omnipod Dash compatibility
* Fingerstick blood glucose prompts when data is stale
* Non-pump insulin entry within the app
* Remote Carb/Bolus capability


## Building Loop 3

When Loop 3 is released, the build instructions will be updated (please allow a few days for documentation to catch up. Experienced users are testing Loop-dev using the [Loop-dev](../build/step13.md#advanced-users-only) download and build instructions. Do not build Loop-dev unless you are willing to pay attention to announcements on zulipchat and build frequently (plan on once a week.)

!!! warning "Users of dev Branch"
    It is up to you to review these new pages for the information you need.

    Please subscribe to the [Documentation Stream](https://loop.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/270362-documentation) on zulipchat. You will see a post there every time LoopDocs is updated.


Those of us who have been testing Loop-dev are very excited for this major update.

## Set Up Loop 3 Overview

!!! success "Congratulations on Building Loop!"

The first time you build Loop 3 on any device, you must go through the onboarding process. This is true even if your device has an earlier version of Loop on it. This is documented on the [Onboarding](onboarding.md) page. But don't click on that link yet.

First some orientation:

### New Loopers

* Review these 3 pages before you touch any buttons on your app
    * [Onboarding](onboarding.md)
    * [Add CGM](add-cgm.md)
    * [Add Pump](add-pump.md)
* Read the rest of the pages listed under [All Loopers](#all-loopers), below
    * The information on the pages will become clearer as you learn to use the app
    * Plan to return to these pages later
* Complete the [Onboarding](onboarding.md) steps to set up Loop
* Learn to use Loop starting with the [Open Loop](../operation/loop/open-loop.md) page
* Once you are comfortable with your settings and manual control of Loop, move on to the [Closed Loop](../operation/loop/close-loop.md) page
* Make suggestions if you think parts of LoopDocs could be clarified, especially from the viewpoint of a brand-new Looper

### Experienced Loopers

* Review the [Onboarding](onboarding.md) page and look for experienced Looper information - especially when building Loop 3 on a device that already has a Loop app on it.
* Read the pages listed under [All Loopers](#all-loopers), below
    - Some of the screens and user interface changed with Loop 3
    - Many of the new Loop 3 features are described in those pages
    - Reach out if information is missing or needs to be clarified
* LoopDocs design
    * Sections specific to experienced Loopers are after the sections for new Loopers
    * The goal is to make LoopDocs easier for new Loopers to navigate
    * Experienced Loopers should scroll ahead, check the page table of contents or use the search feature

### All Loopers

All Loopers should review these pages with detailed Loop 3 information:

* [Displays](displays_v3.md)
* [Settings](settings.md)
* [Therapy Settings](therapy-settings.md)
* [Optional Services](../operation/loop-settings/services.md)
