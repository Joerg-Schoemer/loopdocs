# Loop 3 Overview


Loop 3.0 will be the next big release. It is being developed and tested under the dev branch (Loop-dev). Loop-dev has significant improvements and looks different (in some ways) from the Loop 2.2.x versions.

!!! info "Loop-dev"
    At the current time, the dev branch of Loop is under test by experienced loopers. If you are testing Loop-dev, the version number reported on your settings screen is Loop v2.3.0 (57). 

    To report to developers about which particular version of Loop-dev you are running, look at the top of the [Loop Report](settings.md#issue-a-loop-report) under `Build Details`. The 7-digit alphanumeric indication to the right of workspaceGitRevision is sufficient.
    
    When this version is released, it will be Loop 3.0 and the interface for Loop 3.x versions will use this updated documentation.

    To make life easier for those of us preparing the new documentation, the wording on many pages in the Loop 3 section is set in the future - after the release
    
    This page will be updated and it and the rest of the Loop 3 section will be moved to Set Up App with the Loop 2.2.x version maintained under a sub-menu


## New with Loop 3

!!! info ""
    Information from this section will be moved to the Version / Releases page after release.

Loop 3 provides a major redesign of the app, building off the public portion of some Tidepool work in addition to the DIY contributors. There is a lot of work "under-the-hood" with Loop 3 that may not be obvious to the user, but makes the app more robust.

Here are some highlights:

* Onboarding protocol with guardrails to assist in configuring settings
* Streamlined main screen display and user experience
* Better alerts and notifications
* Omnipod Dash compatibility
* Fingerstick blood glucose prompts when data is stale
* Non-pump insulin entry within the app
* Remote Carb/Bolus capability


## Building Loop 3

When Loop 3 is released, the build instructions will be updated (please allow a few days for documentation to catch up.) In the meantime, experienced users are testing Loop-dev and starting with the [Loop-dev](../build/step13.md#advanced-users-only) download and build instructions. Do not build Loop-dev unless you are willing to pay attention to announcements on zulipchat and build frequently (plan on once a week.)

!!! warning "Users of dev Branch"
    It is up to you to review these new pages for the information you need.
    
    Please subscribe to the [Documentation Stream](https://loop.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/270362-documentation) on zulipchat. You will see a post there every time LoopDocs is updated.


Those of us who have been testing Loop-dev are very excited for this major update.
