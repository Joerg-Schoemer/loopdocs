# Loop 3 Overview

!!! info "Loop-dev vs Loop 3"
    At the current time, the dev branch of Loop is under test by experienced loopers. If you are testing Loop-dev, the version number reported on your settings screen is Loop v2.3.0 (57). 
    
    To prepare for the time when both Loop 2 and Loop 3 are being used, and to assist folks testing Loop-dev in preparation for the release, a new section has been added to the LoopDocs menu structure. 
    
    To minimize the editing needed for these docs when Loop 3 is released, this new section refers to Loop 3 (not Loop-dev or Loop v2.3.0).

Loop 3 is the next big release expected (not yet - wait for it). Loop 3 will have significant improvements and will look different (in some ways) from the 2.x versions.

For the most part, Loop users should follow all the typical Build App, Set up App and Operate instructions. Eventually, once Loop 3 is released, links will be added to the Loop 2 pages to indicate there is a special version of that page for Loop 3.

!!! warning "Users of dev Branch"
    Those "future" links from Loop 2 to Loop 3 have not been added - it is up to you to review the Loop 3 section for the information you need.

It is anticipated that both Loop 2 and Loop 3 will both be in use for at least a year after Loop 3 is released.

Those of us who have been testing Loop 3 are very excited for this major update.
