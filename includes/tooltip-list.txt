*[CR]: Carb Ratio; how many grams of carbs are covered by one unit of rapid-acting insulin
*[Delivery Limits]: max bolus and max basal rates allowed by your therapy settings
*[DIA]: Duration of Insulin Action, includes the full time insulin is active include a long, low-level tail

*[Glucose Safety Limit]: Loop will not suggest insulin delivery when glucose prediction (in next 3 hours) goes below this limit 
*[Guardrails]: limits in the code for user selected settings, recommended and absolute limits are provided
*[ICE]: Insulin Counteraction Effect - Loop models the expected glucose change based on carbs entered, absorption time and your settings; and adjusts based on measured glucose
*[IOB]: Insulin on Board, affects automated insulin delivery: the current active insulin (above or below the basal rate) that Loop calculates and uses for glucose prediction
*[iOS]: operating system used by Apple Mobile devices (iPhone, iPod)
*[ISF]: Insulin Sensitivity Factor; how many points your blood sugar will drop for each unit of insulin
*[Issue]: On github - a formal method to report a problem, either code behavior or documentation
*[macOS]: operating system for Mac computer
*[Lock your Phone]: click the button on the side of the phone to lock it - prevent accidental touch, i.e., accidental Loop command
*[Loop Cycle]: typically 5 minutes: new CGM reading, prediction update, pump update and, if in Closed Loop, dosing update if needed
